### Our team:

We are first year students of the program CS@UCU Ukrainian Catholic University. One day, sitting in our IT-space we wondered what actual things at this point in our world? The first actual thing was that a lot of people sitting in their homes now and almost never goes out, don't do sport. A second thing is that all people are very fond of competing with each other.

We asked: So why don't we try to combine these two things together?

And this is how Quester appeared

What is it and how to use it?
Our project is that we offer you to perform various quests in the open air, earn levels and compete with your friends!

At this stage of development, our team can offer you two types of quests: sports and historical.

The idea is that you will receive a randomly generated quests to do.
